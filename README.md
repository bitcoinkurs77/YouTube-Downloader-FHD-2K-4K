# YT-Downloader-FHD-2K-4K
**The easiest and fastest video downloader from YouTube**🎬  
Insert the link → select the quality → click "Download". All in a couple of clicks.

**The main advantage** is that it downloads **the original video and audio quality without any compression (re-encoding)**.  
In other words, you get exactly the same quality that YouTube gives on the server — without loss of detail, without unnecessary compression and without image/sound degradation.

## 🔥 Key Features

- **Original quality without re-compression** - video and audio are taken directly from YouTube streams (VP9 / AV1 / AAC, etc.)
- Support for **FHD (1080p), 2K (1440p), 4K (2160p),** and lower - if the video is uploaded in this resolution
- Very high download speed (multi-threaded download)
- Works with almost **any** YouTube video (regular videos, Shorts, stream archives, etc.)
- The simplest interface - literally 1-2 windows
- Does not require manual installation of ffmpeg / yt-dlp (everything is built into the .exe version)
- Minimalistic and clear design

🎞️ If the video does not support 4K, 2K, or Full HD, the YT-Downloader will use the best available resolution, such as 720p, 480p, or 360p.

⭐ If the program is convenient, give the repository a star!
